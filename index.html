      <p>My research journey began with statistical analysis of gene expression data, where I used tests like Fisher’s exact test and hypergeometric testing to identify overrepresented biological functions. These experiences helped me develop a strong understanding of probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and linear algebra. This statistical grounding now enables me to approach optimization problems in machine learning with greater confidence, particularly in large-scale model development.</p>

      <p>Over time, I’ve transitioned from bioinformatics to general data science and machine learning. I'm currently pursuing my PhD at the <strong>University of Central Florida</strong>, under the supervision of <a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/statistics/person/alexander-mantzaris/">Dr. Alexandros Mantzaris</a>, focusing on efficient tokenization and word embedding methods for integration into large language models (LLMs). As part of this work, we are developing <a href="https://github.com/mantzaris/TextSpace.jl">TextSpace.jl</a>, a Julia-based framework for embedding and processing language representations in scalable AI systems. This includes studying foundation models, transformer architectures, and reinforcement learning strategies to improve language modeling.</p>

      <p>During my Master’s at the <strong>University of South Florida</strong>, I interned at <a href="https://www.shrinerschildrens.org/en/providers-and-research/research-at-shriners-childrens/genomics-institute-laboratory">Shriners Hospitals for Children</a>, where I contributed to the efficient migration and management of massive genomic sequencing data. This required handling high-throughput sequencing files with sensitive patient and family metadata, demanding advanced database management and parallel processing workflows. I utilized shell scripting and bash in Linux-based distributed systems, leveraging my knowledge of job scheduling and cluster resource management to ensure secure, scalable, and high-performance data handling.</p>
