### ✨ About Me

My research journey began with statistical analysis of gene expression data, where I used tests like Fisher’s exact test and hypergeometric testing to identify overrepresented biological functions. These experiences helped me develop a strong understanding of probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and linear algebra. This statistical grounding now enables me to approach optimization problems in machine learning with greater confidence, particularly in large-scale model development.

Over time, I’ve transitioned from bioinformatics to general data science and machine learning. I'm currently pursuing my PhD at the **University of Central Florida**, under the supervision of [Dr. Alexandros Mantzaris](https://sciences.ucf.edu/statistics/person/alexander-mantzaris/), focusing on efficient tokenization and word embedding methods for integration into large language models (LLMs). As part of this work, we are developing [TextSpace.jl](https://github.com/mantzaris/TextSpace.jl), a Julia-based framework for embedding and processing language representations in scalable AI systems. This includes studying foundation models, transformer architectures, and reinforcement learning strategies to improve language modeling.

During my Master’s at the **University of South Florida**, I interned at [Shriners Hospitals for Children](https://www.shrinerschildrens.org/en/providers-and-research/research-at-shriners-childrens/genomics-institute-laboratory), where I contributed to the efficient migration and management of massive genomic sequencing data. This required handling high-throughput sequencing files with sensitive patient and family metadata, demanding advanced database management and parallel processing workflows. I utilized shell scripting and bash in Linux-based distributed systems, leveraging my knowledge of job scheduling and cluster resource management to ensure secure, scalable, and high-performance data handling.
