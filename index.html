        <h2>✨ About Me</h2>
        <p> I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics and Data Science at the University of Central Florida, advised by <a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/statistics/person/alexander-mantzaris/">Dr. Alexander Mantzaris</a>. My current research centers on text embedding optimization and large language model (LLM) structures using complex-valued representations. By incorporating imaginary components, I explore angle-based semantics in directional and positional embeddings. <p> 
        <p> Before my Ph.D., I studied protein topology and molecular dynamics to identify functional binding sites. I used machine learning models and public compound libraries to predict ligand–protein interactions, guiding the design of targeted small molecules. <p> 
        <p> From 2018 to 2023, I worked across academic and clinical research settings, contributing to large-scale genomics and machine learning projects. At the <a href="https://github.com/usfomicshub">Omics Hub at the University of South Florida</a>, I built R Shiny dashboards for microbial profiling (16S, metagenomics) used by the Florida Department of Health, developed a power calculator for microbiome studies using PERMANOVA, and co-led RNA-seq and microbiome analysis workshops. I also developed deep learning models (CNNs, RNNs) to identify epigenetic markers of drug resistance in malaria parasites (Plasmodium falciparum), integrating population genomics and transcriptomics to uncover resistance pathways. In 2020, I supported pediatric precision medicine research at <a href="https://www.shrinerschildrens.org/en/news-and-media/videos/2021/05/genomics-at-shriners-childrens">Genomics at Shriners Children's</a> by automating ETL workflows and migrating petabyte-scale WGS datasets across AWS tiers (S3 to Glacier), cutting storage costs significantly. In 2022, I joined the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (<a href="https://www.hhmi.org/">HHMI</a>), where I led NGS data analysis (RNA-seq, WGS) for neurological disease studies and built machine learning pipelines with tree-based models to prioritize disease-associated variants. </p>
        <p> As part of my Ph.D. training at UCF since 2023, I’ve gained broad experience in advanced statistical modeling, including both frequentist and Bayesian inference. Our program emphasizes deep learning architectures such as transformers, graph neural networks, and diffusion models, alongside probabilistic methods like MCMC and variational inference. We also receive rigorous training in optimization techniques ranging from gradient and subgradient methods to linear, nonlinear, and integer programming, preparing us to tackle complex modeling tasks across domains. </p>
        <p> Outside research, I’ve always been drawn to the delicate details that others might overlook. I love reading about history, listening to classical music, and watching ballet, art forms I don’t practice myself but which remind me of life’s hidden intricacies. Beneath the surface of their seeming rigidity lies a quiet complexity, a rhythm of precision and expression. That same mindset of unfolding layers to find beauty and meaning shapes how I approach my work. <p>
