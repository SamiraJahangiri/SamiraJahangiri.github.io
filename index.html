  Over time, I’ve transitioned from bioinformatics to general data science and machine learning. I'm currently pursuing my PhD at the <strong>University of Central Florida</strong>, under the supervision of <a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/statistics/person/alexander-mantzaris/">Dr. Alexandros Mantzaris</a>, focusing on efficient tokenization and word embedding methods for integration into large language models (LLMs). As part of this work, we are developing <a href="https://github.com/mantzaris/TextSpace.jl">TextSpace.jl</a>, a Julia-based framework for embedding and processing language representations in scalable AI systems...
